Quick Start
------------

Run `apeman init` command in your project root.

```bash
# Initialize a current directory as an apemanfile.
$ apeman init
```

This generates a file named **Apemanfile.js** , which contains configurations for an apeman project.

Then you can use various apeman commands at the directory.
